    <h2>Version V6.62 (2020-01-24)</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Commander</h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Extended the output message of the IsHalted command to also show the current PC in case CPU is halted. </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Configurator</h3>
      <ol>
        <li> J-Trace PRO probes were displayed as &quot;J-Link (unknown)&quot;. Fixed. </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>DLL</h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Target RAM address was not correct for the MKL27Z32xxx4 devices. Fixed. </li>
        <li> The RWW section of ATSAMC2x/ATSAMD2x devices was not erased before programming. Fixed. </li>
        <li> Added QSPI flash programming support for Nuclei N1xx, N2xx, N3xx, N6xx series cores bistreams on ARTY boards. </li>
        <li> Added new command string &quot;CORESIGHT_SetDebugAPToUse&quot; for allow specifying the APBaseAddr for CoreSight SoC-600 setups. </li>
        <li> Cortex-M: Added support for CoreSight SoC-600 setups. </li>
        <li> Firmware update: When suppressing the firmware update dialog, the DLL crashed. Introduced in V6.60. Fixed. </li>
        <li> Flash programming dialog could crash. Introduced in V6.60. Fixed. </li>
        <li> Flash programming dialog could show &quot;0.000s&quot; for some steps even though they took time. Introduced in V6.60. Fixed. </li>
        <li> Flasher ARM: Open flash loader: When programming very large chunks at once in RAMCode (&gt; 32 KB), USB communication could lock-up. Fixed. </li>
        <li> Flasher PRO: Open flash loader: When programming very large chunks at once in RAMCode (&gt; 32 KB), USB communication could lock-up. Fixed. </li>
        <li> Flasher Portable PLUS: Open flash loader: When programming very large chunks at once in RAMCode (&gt; 32 KB), USB communication could lock-up. Fixed. </li>
        <li> Improved/Reduced DLL startup time. </li>
        <li> Linux: If a file was specified to be opened exclusively (e.g. SEGGER registry), this did not work correctly, so a 2nd process could modify the file at the same time. Fixed. </li>
        <li> RISC-V: Added support for CoreSight SoC-600 setups. </li>
        <li> RISC-V: JALR rd, rs1, SImm instruction was simulated incorrectly if rd == rs1. Fixed. </li>
        <li> Reduced number of alloc calls when evaluating JLinkDevices.xml by factor 14,000 which results in a speed improvement of 10-20% during XML parse. </li>
        <li> Reduced time for Cortex-M connect up to 64ms (depending on host system). </li>
        <li> Unified display of flash bank sizes for device selection dialogs across all J-Link utilities. </li>
        <li> Windows 10: Flash programming progress dialog could flicker. Fixed. </li>
        <li> Nordic Semi nRF5340 Application core: When the application core is protected and we wanted to connect to it, we accidentally would have connected to the network core. Fixed. </li>
        <li> ARMv8-M: Under special circumstances, when running code in non secure mode, system reset did not work. Fixed. </li>
