This is make.info, produced by makeinfo version 6.1 from make.texi.

This file documents the GNU 'make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and
issues the commands to recompile them.

   This is Edition 0.74, last updated 15 August 2019, of 'The GNU Make
Manual', for GNU 'make' version 4.2.1_st_20190816-0744.
